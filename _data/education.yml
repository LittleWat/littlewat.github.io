    I was a member at [machine intelligence in UbiComp (Shimosaka) Lab.](http://www.miubiq.cs.titech.ac.jp/), where I researched in IoT. Specifically, we developed a human activity recognition system in smart-home utilizing multi kinds of data gained from smartwatches, beacons, and electric energy meters.

    I spent a lot of my free time as [a mechanical engineering member](http://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng/engpower/features/making/) of [RoboTech (Robot Contest) Club](https://tuk.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/robotech/)
